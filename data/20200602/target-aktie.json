Ultimately, though, it's up to the US government to decide whether that's reason to reverse course on other aspects of foreign policy. The two-year target of $200bn in increased Chinese imports from the US in the phase one trade deal signed in January was already looking challenging.

This line of thinking may be a bit frightening for fans to hear, as it sounds like the same old Knicks decisions: preferring an inefficient shooter like Anthony to a more well rounded (if raw) prospect in Hayes. Additionally, it shows where Rose's head may be at. If Hayes isn't a target because the organization wants to avoid a slow rebuild, Rose may try to use his connections to attempt to make a team this team a winner as fast as possible. Unfortunately, this strategy of cutting corners on a rebuild has been a sin of Knicks' team presidents and general managers in the past, so Rose will need to make sure his plan is foolproof.
